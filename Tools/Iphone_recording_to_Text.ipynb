But when I was filling in the information for the pre-mastering, honing it, then it kind depends on how many courses I would have to do to be able, in the pre-master, to be able to do it. And I have from my own estimation, I'm kind of at the border. So what I could do is either buy materials from their thing or medical technology said my faculty. But it would take a lot more time and I kind of want to have a more chill and the fetch there as far as that can happen.

And at 3.30 I think, and if I'm not here, Nink is grandfather probably has to come over or she was just gonna let the guy key and I was like, well that's a bit weird. So I was thinking maybe if you want to come here and then if the guy leaves we can go to yours. Oh wait, but then you have to wait 3 hours because I'm not in class later. Well I mean if you need to do homework in a library, that could be a thing. And I mean we can also just do homework here and then we're not allowed to do homework after 5 anymore. Just said that as a rule on Friday, no homework after 5. So I'm not continuously going back and forth. What's these? I will be doing homework on Saturday.

Having a hip-hop plan meeting on Friday was not on my schedule, especially since I have to do all the research beforehand. But so my idea for Thursday was just to do a co-clamming and then work on that. But when I went into Chris yesterday, he really wanted to do something before he would leave for Christmas, since he has just been studying and also couldn't make it to the Christmas dinner thingy. And I am really bad at saying no to people who are upset. So we settled that the only time we were available was Thursday night. And we were thinking maybe game night or something, because I was like, well, you know, living in girls who are leaving off holidays, so I don't know if they have time. Mainly because I don't know if they have time, but oh well. So I got home and asked, live in and she's going, bouldering with your own. So she was like, well, I mean, you guys can join and then maybe Jon can also come. So we're going bouldering. But I don't know if it's too far for you or whatever, but hereby you are invited. If you want to join, this message contains so much unnecessary information, but a fun listening to it. It might be kind of late though, because we're probably only going at sevenish.
