# Collection-of-Projects

Hi, welcome to my archive!
This is what my coding mind has been up to over the last few years in my free time.

Most (basically all) of these projects were built in Google Colab and have not been updated to run locally. Think of this repo as a legacy showcase of my spare-time coding.

In my free time during university, like everyone else, I liked to:

1. Plot immigration numbers to explore if/where our country faces immigration issues using data.
2. Sort my Magic: The Gathering cards by exporting them, converting the SQL database, and automatically regex-matching and sourcing card data via APIs. After converting the database using a .apk, I also built a word-matching algorithm against our Groningen database to see if I can add any cards to our Big Box, one of the largest MtG singleton collections that exist.
3. Write a vaccination simulation based on (semi) game theory and compute risk using literature models and data.
4. Manipulate save data for a beta-access single-player game to change skill trees by byte-injecting into the compressed save file—without using Unity/Unreal Engine.

…and many more small projects.

You can find most data-science projects under `Data/`, and personal handy tools under `Tools/`.
Additionally, `Science/` shows some small personal projects I wanted to try. The rest should be self-explanatory.
