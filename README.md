# Collection-of-Projects

Hi, Welcome to my archive!
This is what my coding mind has been upto for the last years in my free time.
In my free time, I liked to:

Plot the immigration numbers to find out if and what immigration problems our country had by using data.
Sort my Magic card by exporting them, converting the sql database and automatically regex matching and sourcing API data for cards, after converting the SQL database using an .apk
Find out what water issues exist, and then trying to convince the UN to make a working API.
And more!
